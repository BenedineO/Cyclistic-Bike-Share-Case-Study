# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Case-Study

Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?
Introduction to Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis
In this case study, I will assume the role of a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company. Cyclistic, along with some key team members.I will work through the data analysis process - asking questions, preparing and processing data, analyzing insights, sharing findings, and recommending actions - to address key business questions and drive informed decision-making.

Scenario
As a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, my objective is to analyze bike usage patterns among casual riders and annual members, identifying key differences to inform a targeted marketing strategy that converts casual riders into annual members, and presenting findings with data-driven insights and compelling visualizations to secure executive approval.

Company Overview
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers,Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

Ask Phase
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
My Task
Moreno, the director of marketing has assigned me the first question: * - How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? I was assigned the task to determine how annual and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

Prepare Phase
I will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement. I will choose to work with Divvy Trips 2019 Q1 and 2020 datasets. This is public data that I will use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues prohibit me from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that I won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
